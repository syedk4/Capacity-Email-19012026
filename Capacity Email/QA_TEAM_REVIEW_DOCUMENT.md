## 📋 Document Purpose
This document is created for the QA team to review, validate, and provide suggestions on the Sprint Capacity Automation System developed by the Lead QA.

**Review Date:** February 6, 2026  
**Version:** 2.0 (with Location-Based Holiday Support)  
**Team:** Finance Aspirants Team

---

## 🎯 System Overview

### What Does This System Do?
The Sprint Capacity Automation System automatically calculates team capacity for 2-week sprints by:
- Reading employee data and leave plans from Excel
- Calculating working days based on employee location (GCC/India vs US)
- Applying location-specific holidays (GCC holidays vs US holidays)
- Accounting for on-call rotations and their impact on capacity
- Generating detailed reports in text, HTML, and email formats
- Sending automated email reports to stakeholders

### Key Features
1. ✅ **Location-Based Holiday Support** - Different holiday calendars for India and US team members
2. ✅ **On-Call Rotation Tracking** - Primary and Secondary on-call assignments
3. ✅ **Capacity Reduction for On-Call** - Primary on-call person gets reduced development hours
4. ✅ **Multi-Format Reports** - Text, HTML, and Email template generation
5. ✅ **Automated Email Delivery** - Reports sent automatically to stakeholders
6. ✅ **Holiday Count Display** - Shows GCC and US holiday counts separately

## 📊 Capacity Calculation Logic - DETAILED EXPLANATION

### 1. Working Days Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Working Days = Total Weekdays in Sprint (Monday-Friday only)
```

**Example for Sprint 2 (Jan 14 - Jan 27, 2026):**
- Total calendar days: 14 days
- Weekdays (Mon-Fri): 10 days
- Weekends (Sat-Sun): 4 days
- **Working Days = 10**

**Important:** Working days count is the SAME for all employees initially. Location-based holidays are applied in the next step.

---

### 2. Location-Based Working Days

**Each employee gets different working days based on their location:**

**For GCC/India Employees:**
```
Employee Working Days = Total Weekdays - GCC Holidays in Sprint
```

**For US Employees:**
```
Employee Working Days = Total Weekdays - US Holidays in Sprint
```

**Example for Sprint 2:**
- Total Weekdays: 10 days
- GCC Holidays: Jan 15 (Republic Day Eve), Jan 26 (Republic Day) = 2 days
- US Holidays: Jan 19 (Martin Luther King Jr. Day) = 1 day

**GCC Employee Working Days:** 10 - 2 = **8 days**  
**US Employee Working Days:** 10 - 1 = **9 days**

---

### 3. Ideal Capacity Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Ideal Capacity = Σ (Each Employee's Working Days × Hours per Day) - On-Call Reduction
```

**Step-by-Step Calculation for Sprint 2:**

**Team Composition:**
- 7 GCC employees (India-based)
- 3 US employees

**Hours per Day:** 6 hours (configured in config.json)

**Step 1: Calculate capacity for GCC employees**
```
GCC Capacity = 7 employees × 8 working days × 6 hours/day
GCC Capacity = 7 × 8 × 6 = 336 hours
```

**Step 2: Calculate capacity for US employees**
```
US Capacity = 3 employees × 9 working days × 6 hours/day
US Capacity = 3 × 9 × 6 = 162 hours
```

**Step 3: Total capacity before on-call reduction**
```
Total = 336 + 162 = 498 hours
```

**Step 4: Apply on-call reduction**
- Primary on-call: Lakshmipathy (GCC employee)
- On-call reduction: 2 hours/day (configured in config.json)
- On-call working days: 10 days (ALL weekdays, including GCC holidays)
```
On-Call Reduction = 10 days × 2 hours/day = 20 hours
```

**Step 5: Final Ideal Capacity**
```
Ideal Capacity = 498 - 20 = 478 hours
```

**✅ This matches the report: Ideal Capacity: 478.0 hours**

---

### 4. Actual Capacity Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Actual Capacity = Ideal Capacity - Total Leave Hours
```

**Leave Hours Calculation:**
```
Leave Hours = Σ (Each employee's leave days × Hours per Day)
```

**Example for Sprint 2:**

| Employee | Leave Days | Hours per Day | Leave Hours |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Suganya Chandrasekaran | 1 (Jan 22) | 6 | 6 |
| Dhivya Dharmaraj | 2 (Jan 16, 19) | 6 | 12 |
| Sampanthamoorthy, Sivaguru | 2 (Jan 14, 16) | 6 | 12 |
| Murugan Pavithra | 2 (Jan 14, 16) | 6 | 12 |
| Satish KambleOne | 1 (Jan 21) | 6 | 6 |
| Satish KambleTwo | 1 (Jan 22) | 6 | 6 |
| Satish KambleThree | 1 (Jan 23) | 6 | 6 |
| **Total** | **10 days** | | **60 hours** |

**Actual Capacity:**
```
Actual Capacity = 478 - 60 = 418 hours
```

**✅ This matches the report: Actual Capacity: 418.0 hours**

---

### 5. Team Capacity Percentage

**Formula:**
```
Team Capacity % = (Actual Capacity ÷ Ideal Capacity) × 100
```

**Example for Sprint 2:**
```
Team Capacity % = (418 ÷ 478) × 100 = 87.4%
```

**✅ This matches the report: GCC Team Capacity: 87.4%**

## 🔍 Validation Checklist for QA Team

### ✅ Data Validation

1. **Employee Count**
   - [ ] Verify total team members count (should be 10)
   - [ ] Verify GCC employees count (should be 7)
   - [ ] Verify US employees count (should be 3)

2. **Working Days**
   - [ ] Count weekdays in sprint manually (exclude Sat/Sun)
   - [ ] Verify working days = weekdays count
   - [ ] Example: Sprint 2 (Jan 14-27) should have 10 weekdays

3. **Holiday Counts**
   - [ ] Verify GCC holiday count matches Excel "Holiday" column
   - [ ] Verify US holiday count matches Excel "Holiday" column
   - [ ] Check holiday dates are within sprint period

4. **Leave Data**
   - [ ] Verify each employee's planned leave matches Excel
   - [ ] Check leave dates are parsed correctly
   - [ ] Verify leave dates fall within sprint period

5. **On-Call Assignments**
   - [ ] Verify Primary on-call name matches "On Call Schedules" sheet
   - [ ] Verify Secondary on-call name matches "On Call Schedules" sheet
   - [ ] Check on-call dates align with sprint dates

---

### ✅ Calculation Validation

**Use the formulas provided above to manually verify:**

1. **Ideal Capacity Calculation**
   - [ ] Calculate GCC employee capacity: (GCC count × GCC working days × 6)
   - [ ] Calculate US employee capacity: (US count × US working days × 6)
   - [ ] Add both capacities
   - [ ] Subtract on-call reduction (10 days × 2 hours = 20 hours)
   - [ ] Compare with report's "Ideal Capacity"

2. **Actual Capacity Calculation**
   - [ ] Count total leave days from the table
   - [ ] Multiply by 6 hours/day to get total leave hours
   - [ ] Subtract from Ideal Capacity
   - [ ] Compare with report's "Actual Capacity"

3. **Team Capacity Percentage**
   - [ ] Divide Actual by Ideal
   - [ ] Multiply by 100
   - [ ] Compare with report's "Team Capacity %"

---

### ✅ Report Format Validation

1. **Text Report**
   - [ ] Check all sprints are displayed (Sprint 2, 3, 4, 5)
   - [ ] Verify holiday counts format: "Holidays:" header with "GCC - X" and "US - Y" indented
   - [ ] Check on-call information is displayed
   - [ ] Verify employee table has all columns: Emp ID, Name, Planned Leave, GCC Holiday, US Holiday

2. **HTML Report**
   - [ ] Open HTML report in browser
   - [ ] Check metrics grid displays: Working Days, Holidays, Team Members, Team Capacity, Ideal/Actual Capacity
   - [ ] Verify holiday counts show "GCC - X" and "US - Y" separated by line break
   - [ ] Check capacity percentage color coding (Green ≥90%, Yellow 80-90%, Red <80%)
   - [ ] Verify employee table formatting and readability

3. **Email Template**
   - [ ] Check email shows next 2 upcoming sprints only
   - [ ] Verify same format as HTML report
   - [ ] Check all metrics are displayed correctly

- Team Capacity: 93.8%

**Validation Steps:**
1. Verify no holiday line is displayed
2. Check GCC Holiday and US Holiday columns show "-" for all employees
3. Calculate ideal capacity: (7 × 10 × 6) + (3 × 10 × 6) - 20 = 580 hours

---

### Test Scenario 3: Sprint with Only US Holiday
**Sprint:** Sprint 4 (Feb 11 - Feb 24, 2026)

**Expected Results:**
- Working Days: 10
- Holidays: US - 1
- US Holiday: Feb 12 (Lincoln's Birthday)
- No GCC holidays
- Ideal Capacity: 582.0 hours
- Team Capacity: 85.6%

**Validation Steps:**
1. Verify only "US - 1" is shown in holidays
2. Check only US employees show Feb 12 in US Holiday column

---

### Test Scenario 4: On-Call Reduction Validation
**Sprint:** Sprint 2 (Primary: Lakshmipathy)

**Expected On-Call Reduction:**
- Primary on-call works ALL weekdays (10 days) including GCC holidays
- Reduction: 2 hours/day × 10 days = 20 hours

**Validation Steps:**
