## .env File Reference

| Variable | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| GMAIL_SENDER_EMAIL | user@gmail.com | Your Gmail address (who sends) |
| GMAIL_SENDER_PASSWORD | abc123def456ghi | Gmail App Password (NOT regular password) |
| GMAIL_SMTP_SERVER | smtp.gmail.com | SMTP server (leave default) |
| GMAIL_SMTP_PORT | 587 | SMTP port (leave default) |
| SCRUM_MASTER_EMAIL | scrum@company.com | Who receives reports |

## Security Notes

✅ `.env` file is added to `.gitignore`  
✅ Safe to commit `.gitignore` (not `.env` itself)  
✅ Each team member needs their own `.env` file  
✅ Never share `.env` file or commit it to git

---

## What to Edit

**EDIT THESE VALUES:**
```
GMAIL_SENDER_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com          ← Your email
GMAIL_SENDER_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password  ← App password
SCRUM_MASTER_EMAIL=scrum-master@company.com      ← Recipient email
```

**LEAVE THESE AS-IS:**
```
GMAIL_SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com                 ← Don't change
GMAIL_SMTP_PORT=587                              ← Don't change
```

---

## Verification

After editing `.env`, run:
```bash
py sprint_capacity_app.py --analyze
```

If successful, you'll see:
```
✓ Email template created: reports\email_template_filled_XXXXXXX.html
```

If credentials are wrong, you'll see:
```
✗ Email configuration incomplete. Skipping email send.
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Email configuration incomplete" | Check `.env` file values are not empty |
| "Authentication failed" | Verify App Password (not Gmail password) |
| ".env file not found" | Make sure `.env` is in the same directory as `sprint_capacity_app.py` |
| Changes not taking effect | Restart Python/IDE to reload `.env` |

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I use my Gmail password?**  
A: No, use App Password instead. Gmail requires App Passwords for security.

**Q: Can I share the `.env` file?**  
A: No, it has sensitive credentials. Each person keeps their own `.env`.

**Q: Is `.env` file safe?**  
A: Yes, it's in `.gitignore` so it won't be committed to git.

**Q: Can I use multiple email addresses?**  
A: Currently, only one sender email. For multiple, edit `GMAIL_SENDER_EMAIL`.
